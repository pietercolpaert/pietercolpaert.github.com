{"name":".about","tagline":"The personal site of Pieter Colpaert","body":"I believe a lot of frustration today is caused by data not being accessible (when does my train leave, how long do I have to queue, where does my money go, and so on).\r\n\r\nYou can find me here as well:\r\n[Twitter](http://twitter.com/pietercolpaert), [my personal blog](http://blog.pieter.pm), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/110114073598043885251/posts/p/pub) or [Linkedin](http://be.linkedin.com/in/pcolpaert/)\r\n\r\nI live in in a small apartment in [one of the most wonderful cities](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/crafterm/40769811/lightbox/) in the world. If you are nearby Ghent, I am always up for a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n## Research\r\n\r\nI'm a researcher at [UGent](http://ugent.be) - [iMinds](http://iminds.be) - [Multi Media Lab](http://multimedialab.elis.ugent.be) on Linked Open Transport Data. The topic of my PhD is explained in this TEDx talk:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/XvvozJe8Pic\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nYou can find all my publication at my [university's page biblio.ugent.be](https://biblio.ugent.be/person/000101004177), or at [google scholar](http://scholar.google.be/citations?user=fSlc4YAAAAAJ&hl=nl&oi=ao). Yet, in particular, you might be interested in my work on:\r\n\r\n### E-government\r\n\r\nOn how to structure opening hours, see [OpeningHours.io](http://openinghours.io)\r\n\r\nAnd I have written an article on how to quantify the semantic interoperability of datasets on the basis of user input. The paper is yet to be published in October 2014 in [Computer](http://www.computer.org/).\r\n\r\n### Open Data Portals\r\n\r\nI'm a heavy contributor to [the DataTank](http://thedatatank.com), which is data portal software for local governments. It complies to the European [DCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/description) standard. Furthermore, it gets the best out of your dataset by lifting it as high as possible on the scale of the 5 stars of Linked Open Data.\r\n\r\nIn order to sketch the roadmap of The DataTank, I have written a paper for the MeTTeG conference on [the 5 priorities for data portals](http://pieter.pm/5stardataportals/).\r\n\r\n### Transport data\r\n\r\n_My focus for 2014/2015. Work going on as we speak_\r\n\r\n## Not for profit\r\n\r\nI am\r\n * a board member of the [Belgian chapter](http://okfn.be) of [Open Knowledge](http://okfn.org)\r\n * a community coordinator at the [open transport working group](http://transport.okfn.org) at [Open Knowledge](http://okfn.org).\r\n\r\n## For profit\r\n\r\nPreviously, I have started a company in real-time digital signage called [FlatTurtle](https://flatturtle.com). The company is still [active](http://blog.flatturtle.com).\r\n\r\n# Contact me\r\n\r\npieter [dot] colpaert a≈ß okfn.org","google":"UA-37999668-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
